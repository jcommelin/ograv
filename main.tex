\section{General plan}

Give an overview of what is known:
\cite{MR1603865},
\cite{MR3494322},
Noot?

Prove that having ordinary reduction at~$v$ only depends on the adjoint motive.
Conclude that it suffices to look at irreducbile abelian motives.

Prove the good ordinary reduction conjecture
for irreducible abelian motives of type $A_n^\wedge$.

$\bullet$\quad Need to figure out how to use categories of motives
with coefficients in some field~$E$.

If $M$ is an adjoint motive,
then $E = \mathrm{End}(M)$ is a totally real field.
Thus we could extend coefficients to the real closure of~$E$,
and get a nice decomposition of~$M$.

$\bullet$\quad How does this change of coefficients interact
with the good ordinary reduction conjecture?

\section{Introduction}

Let $K \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a finitely generated field.
Let $X/K$ be a smooth projective variety.


There is the following general philosophy.
