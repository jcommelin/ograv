\author{Johan Commelin}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{General plan}

Give an overview of what is known:
\cite{MR1603865},
\cite{MR3494322},
Noot?

Prove that having ordinary reduction at~$v$ only depends on the adjoint motive.
Conclude that it suffices to look at irreducbile abelian motives.

Prove the good ordinary reduction conjecture
for irreducible abelian motives of type $A_n^\wedge$.

\section{Introduction}

Let $K \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a finitely generated field.
Let $X/K$ be a smooth projective variety.


There is the following general philosophy.
